# FELIZ-JUEVES V2 


A small discord bot that uses the Discord API to send a video (video listed in repo) every thursday using the node-cron library and when someone sends "jueves" in any channel. 

It is currently a work in progress but the files necessary to run it are left here to see updates for the bot roll out slowly but surely.
Eventually, I'm planning on making this bot essentially act as a random meme generator where it'll fetch a meme from a personal database and send it to whoever used the command, currently however it is very primitive.

This project more or less stemmed from a first iteration I created that frankly was very low quality and was created for a discord server that I am a part of. I aim to make this version a bit more robust while archving the original version for viewing. It's very bad, I promise you.

Currently, the bot is being hosted locally, but once all the features have been ironed out, I plan out hosting the bot using a cloud provider and publishing the bot for people to see.
